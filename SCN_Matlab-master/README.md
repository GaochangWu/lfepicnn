# SCN_Matlab
This is a reimplementation of SCN-SR ([original](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~dingliu2/iccv15/)) in Matlab. And I forked the original code of [1] in "python_iccv".   

# Instruction
Demo_SR : a simple demo. 

Demo_SR_Conv: another simple demo implemented all by convolution operations. Convolution operations can help you understand the network structure in [1].

# Test Code Dependencies
Matlab

[MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) for Demo_SR_Conv.
# Training Code
I implemented the training code by caffe, and I will share it on github after finishing my test !

Please cite [1] if you use this code in your work, thank you!
