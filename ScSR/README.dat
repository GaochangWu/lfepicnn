================================================================
Demo_SR.m: demo code for image super-resolution via sparse recovery 

1. The demo code is for upscaling factor of 2. For larger magnification factors, run the function "ScSR.m" multiple times. Note the code is a little different from what presented in the TIP10 paper. Please find the previous codes and results in folder "Previous".

2. Two pre-trained dictionaries are provided in directory "Dictionary". The dictionaries are for zoom factor of 2. You can train your own dictionary based on function "Demo_Dictionary_Training.m" talked below.

================================================================
Demo_Dictionary_Training.m: demo code for training the dictionary

1. If you want to train your own dictionary, replace the training images in subfolder "Data/Training" by yours.

2. You need to inspect the statistics of your sampled patches to prune those smooth patches.
