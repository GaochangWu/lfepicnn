These are the numerical recipies routines for conjugate gradient
descent.  They have been modified to make the 1d line minimizations
efficient.

frprmn.c:	main routine for executing conj. grad.
linmin.c:	line minimization algorithm
mnbrak.c:	routine for bracketing the minimum
brent.c:	finds minimum via Brent's method
